# Handmade _SDL_

_Handmade SDL_ is a humble C++ game engine framework wrapped around the popular and cross-platform _Simple DirectMedia Layer_ library. It was designed as a teaching tool, allowing students and aspiring game programmers to make simple 2D sprite-based games while learning intermediate and advanced C++ concepts. The engine can load images, render animations, play audio, display text, handle basic collisions, and integrate UI features via the _ImGui_ library. It currently only supports _Windows 10_, but if you wish to use the engine in a _MacOS_ or _Linux_ environment, you will need to link the appropriate library files.

# The Wiki

Every bit of robust software out there isn't complete without the proper documentation, and my own project is no exception. Check the attached [Wiki](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Handmade-SDL/wiki) for more technical information about the various parts of the game engine.

# Building the source and running the game engine
Watch my handy [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyw6tVsbbEM) for more information on getting started using the above repo. You'll also learn how the game engine works, discover what each class within does, and master creating your first little game demo.
