# Handmade _SDL_

_Handmade SDL_ is a humble C++ game engine framework wrapped around the popular and cross-platform _Simple DirectMedia Layer_ library. It was designed as a teaching tool, allowing students and aspiring game programmers to make simple 2D sprite-based games while learning intermediate and advanced C++ concepts. The engine can load images, render animations, play audio, display text, handle basic collisions, and integrate UI features via the _ImGui_ library. It currently only supports _Windows 10_, but if you wish to use the engine in a _MacOS_ or _Linux_ environment, you will need to link the appropriate library files.

## Building the source
Whether you clone the repo or directly download the source code, you must generate a working project and environment out of the code and library files provided. You are advised to download and use [CMake](https://cmake.org) to do this. You may wish to use the CMake GUI app or build from the terminal, but whichever method you choose, the CMake source folder is the one you see above, with the _CMakeLists.txt_ file within. Generate the project files into the destination folder of your choice, even if thatâ€™s the same folder as the source folder. In terms of preferred IDE, mine is the industry-standard [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads), and with that in mind, the rest of my documentation will reference this IDE only.

## The Wiki

Every bit of robust software out there isn't complete without the proper documentation, and my own project is no exception. Check the attached [Wiki](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Handmade-SDL/wiki) for more technical information about the various parts of the game engine.

## Using the repo
Watch my handy [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyw6tVsbbEM) for more information on getting started using the above repo. You'll also learn how the game engine works, discover what each class within does, and master creating your first little game demo.
