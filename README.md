# Handmade _SDL_

_Handmade SDL_ is a humble **C++** game engine framework wrapped around the popular and cross-platform **Simple DirectMedia Layer** library. It was designed as a teaching tool, allowing students and aspiring game programmers to make simple 2D sprite-based games while learning intermediate and advanced C++ concepts. The engine can load images, render animations, play audio, display text, and handle basic collisions.

# Building the source

Whether you clone the repo or download the ZIP, you must generate a working project and environment out of the raw source code and library files provided. To do this, it is advised to download and use **CMake**. <br><br> https://cmake.org <br><br>
I prefer to use the CMake GUI app, however, many programmers enjoy the terminal. Whichever method you choose, the CMake source folder is the one you see up above, with the CMakeLists.txt file within. Generate the project files into the destination folder of your choice, even if that is the same folder as the source folder. My preference for IDE to use when developing is **Visual Studio Community 2022**. <br><br> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads 

# The Wiki

Every bit of robust software out there isnâ€™t complete without the proper documentation, and my own project is no exception. However, given the time I have available and the amount of material that needs to be written, the attached [Wiki](https://github.com/karsten-vermeulen-dev/Handmade-SDL/wiki) is very much a work in progress. Keep checking back for updates, and if you'd like to see rapid development of the Wiki (and the game engine), consider ![sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/karsten-vermeulen-dev)
